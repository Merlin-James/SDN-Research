# SDN-Research
The experiment was done on a DELL Inspiron 5558 laptop with Intel (R) Core (TM) i5-5250U CPU @1. 60GHz, 1601 MHz, 2 Core(s), 4 Logical Processor(s). Using Mininet, a tree-type network is created. Its depth is two with five switches and 20 hosts. Open Virtual Switch (OVS) was used for network switches. OVS is a software switch that runs both on hardware and software.The L2_multi.py module of POX was used for the controller. 
To implement the statistical approach, I have added the following modules to the controller program.
